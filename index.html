                        <p>React is a <span class="blue-backdrop">JavaScript Library</span> for building User Interfaces</p>
                        <p class="mt-3">React makes building user interfaces incredibly easy and intuitive</p>
                        <p class="mt-3">We will begin by explaining some important features of React:</p>
                    </header>
                    <div class='content'>
                        <div class='frame-line'>
                            <h1 class='headline' id="declarative"><span class="backdrop">Declarative</span></h1>
                            <p class="mt-3">React is what we call a Declarative Library</p>
                            <p class="mt-3">But what do we really mean when we say React is Declarative?</p>
                            <p class="mt-3">Normally when we want to change elements in JavaScript we write a bunch of code to select the specific element we want to modify</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>For example, we could make HTML change the innerText of some element after the user clicks a button with the '.onclick' event</li>
                                <li>We could also make some message appear after the pages has loaded using the '.onload' event</li>
                                <li>The list of situations where we can use events is endless.</li>
                                <li>All of these elements are being changed with the use of events, React will instead change them in a declaratively way.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="mt-3">So what is this "declarative way"? Explain Further...</p>
                            <p>The HTML will know how to <b>change itself</b> accordingly to the specific value we give it</p>
                            <p>This is what we mean by being declarative</p>

                            <p class="mt-4">This implies that we we dont need to change the HTML code directly.</p>
		                    <p>This makes your code predictable and easier to debug</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="frame-line">
                            <h1 class='headline' id="components"><span class="backdrop">React <span class="blue-backdrop">Components</span></span></h1>
                            <p class="mt-5">React has a feature that we call <span class="blue-backdrop">Components</span></p>
                            <p class="mt-4">Components are the <b>Most Important</b> part of react</p>
                            <div class="chapter">
                                <h2 class='chapter-title'><span class='backdrop'>React: It's Component-Based</span></h2>
                                <p class="mt-3">When we say React is Component-Based, what we actually mean is that instead of building only one giant JavaScript file, which stores a considerable amount of code, we are actually going to build smaller JavaScript files which stores less code overall and which represent only individual parts of our page.</p>
                                <p class="mt-3">These smaller elements will be chained together to build up our entire webpage.</p>
                                <p class="mt-3">This feature makes things easier to manage, before bringing them all together to make more complex UI</p>
                                <p class="mt-5">React changes the mindset of how you're supposed to think about programs</p>
                                <p class="mt-3">React makes us think less about the workflow and more about being <b>component-based</b> and <b>state-based</b></p>
                                <p class="mt-5">Components don't have to be big</p>
                                <p class="mt-3">The same Component can have different appearences in different situations, even if it's the same component, the reason being that this component may have some other components inside of it.</p>
                                <p>example: google react page</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="chapter mt-5">
                                <h2 class='chapter-title'><span class='backdrop'>React: Benefits</span></h2>
                                <p class="mt-3">React is a library that allows us not only to write our HTML but that also allows us to do HTML interact in the way that want with our state</p>
                                <p class="mt-5">React allows us to manage the state inside of our application</p>
                                <p class="mt-3">React also allows us to manage the state and rendering of the user interface and user interaction in the website</p>                                
                                <p class="mt-5">It allows you to automatically re-render your application, everytime you state changes</p>
